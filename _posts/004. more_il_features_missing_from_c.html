<a href="http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/">Wesner Moise</a> wrote about <a href="http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/2009/04/il-features-missing-in-c.html">IL features missing in C#</a>: extended precision for floating-point calculations, and tail call optimizations. His post reminded me of a few more IL features that could be useful in C# but that aren't exposed or aren't documented.</p>

<p><strong><code>ldtoken</code>:</strong> This is the opcode behind <code>typeof</code>. <code>ldtoken</code> also operates on fields and methods, opening up the possibility of hypothetical <code>fieldof</code> and <code>methodof</code> keywords: these might return <code>FieldInfo</code> and <code>MethodInfo</code> objects at runtime respectively, allowing you to write reflection code that's checked at compile time.</p>

<p>There is in fact a trick you can use to get hold of a <code>MethodInfo</code> object without having to call <code>Type.GetMethod</code> or the like:</p>

<p>[code:csharp]
MethodInfo methodInfo = new Action<string>(Console.WriteLine).Method;
[/code]</p>

<p>However, because this trick instantiates a new delegate to use its <code>Method</code> property, it's only useful when:</p>

<ul>
<li>You're dealing with static methods</li>
<li>You have an instance of the right type</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this trick doesn't work on property accessors, since there's no delegate syntax for these like there is for methods.</p>

<p><strong>Typed references:</strong> You may have noticed the <code>System.TypedReference</code> class documented in MSDN, and wondered what it was useful for. C# supports typed references -- effectively safe, verifiable pointers -- via three undocumented keywords.</p>

<p>[code:csharp]
int i = 42;
TypedReference reference = __makeref(i);
Debug.Assert(__reftype(reference) == typeof(int));
Debug.Assert(__refvalue(reference, int) == 42);
[/code]</p>

<p>I haven't seen any official statement from Microsoft saying that this technique is going to stop working any time soon, but they don't seem to be in a hurry to fix <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=347243">bugs relating to</a> <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=339510">these keywords</a>.</p>
