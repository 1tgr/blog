<strong class="alt">Update:</strong> Thanks to the commenters on this blog and on Reddit, I've got [a much improved and more readable Haskell port](http://www.partario.com/blog/2009/11/an-improved-spelling-corrector-in-haskell.html) of the spelling corrector.

On Wednesday I attended the [StackOverflow DevDay](http://stackoverflow.carsonified.com/events/london/) in London, which was a day of excellent talks by engaging speakers. Michael Sparks gave a talk on Python, where he built up [Peter Norvig's spelling corrector](http://www.norvig.com/spell-correct.html) line by line as we watched. I was impressed by how easy it was to understand the source code, and the style struck me as being particularly functional. So, I was compelled to translate the Python source into Haskell.

This post is also a Literate Haskell program, meaning that you should be able to copy the text from the page, paste it into a `.lhs` file, and compile it. Snippets starting with `>` are Haskell; in between is Peter's original program, and my commentary on the differences.

$$code(lang=text)
$$include(code/spelling.lhs#1)
$$/code

Every language needs some imports. The Python program only has two; we're using a scattering of functions outside of the prelude (Haskell's standard library), so we need to import a bit more:

* `Char` gives us `toLower` and `isAlpha`
* `Data.List` gives us `foldl'`
* `Data.Map` gives us the `Map` type
* `Data.Set` gives us the `Set` type
* `Data.Ord` gives us the `comparing` function
* `List` gives us `maximumBy`

$$code(lang=text)
$$include(code/spelling.lhs#2)
$$/code

The Haskell prelude already has a function called words, which splits a string by spaces. `filter isAlpha` and `filter (not . null)` approximate the Python regular expression:

* `filter isAlpha` drops all characters outside of a-z
* `filter (not . null)` excludes any empty strings (such as sequences of numbers or punctuation in the original text)

$$code(lang=text)
$$include(code/spelling.lhs#3)
$$/code

Haskell doesn't need an explicit loop here: we use `foldl'` to iterate over the list of words and add each one to a map. The `Map.insertWith'` function either inserts a value (if missing), or extracts the existing value, applies it to a function, and inserts the result back in the map.

$$code(lang=text)
$$include(code/spelling.lhs#4)
$$/code

A big difference in the Haskell version is that file I/O is encapsulated in an IO monad. So whereas Python's `NWORDS` variable is an actual dictionary, `readNWORDS` is a I/O value that, when executed, reads and parses a file and yields a dictionary.

$$code(lang=text)
$$include(code/spelling.lhs#5)
$$/code

I put a cheeky shortcut in the Haskell version. (It makes no difference to the line count.)

$$code(lang=text)
$$include(code/spelling.lhs#6)
$$/code

The Haskell and Python versions of this function are fairly close. The main differences:

* Haskell uses the `let` ... `in` keywords to declare values
* List comprehension syntax is very similar, if you replace Python's `for` and `in` with Haskell's `|` and `<-`. (Recurring theme: Haskell prefers symbols to keywords.)
* `[ start .. end ]` is Haskell's built-in range syntax. It's lazy, and generates elements only on demand, which means it's fine to construct an infinite list like this: `[ 1 .. ]`
* Python has neat string slicing syntax:
 * `[:i]` is replaced with `take i`, to take the first _i_ characters
 * `[i:]` is replaced with `drop i`, to take all but the first _i_ characters
 * Subscripts can be replaced with the `!!` operators, which does the same thing, but with O(_N_) complexity. Remember Haskell's strings are lists of characters, not arrays (although see `Data.ByteString`).
* Python's `if` keyword maps to different things depending on the context. Here it's used to ask 'is the string empty?', and we replace it with the `not` and `null` functions.
* `++` and `:` stand in for Python's `+` operator, depending on whether we're concatenating two lists (`a ++ b`) or pushing a single element onto the start of a list (`head : tail`)

I'm not totally convinced about the performance of the Haskell version, since `take` and `drop` are O(_N_) and not O(1). However, _N_ is small here, being the length of a word. If it's a problem we could use `ByteString` instead for O(1) complexity at the price of having to copy strings.

$$code(lang=text)
$$include(code/spelling.lhs#7)
$$/code

Here I replaced the Python list comprehensions with Haskell's built-in set functions. We can't iterate directly over a set in Haskell, so if we used a list comprehension here, we'd to use `elems` to produce a list from the set and `fromList` to turn the result into a set again. Here I feel that the Python version demonstrates the intent more clearly, which is to produce a set of edits from `edit1`, then run those through `edit1` again, and keep only the edits that turn out to be real words.

Read from right to left, what the Haskell version does is:

* Produces a set of edits to a word using `edit1`
* For each edit in the set, produce another set of edits using `edit1`, and keep only those edits-of-edits that can be found in `knownWords`. We now have a set of sets.
* Turn a set of sets into a list of sets, using `elems`
* Collapse that list of sets into a single set of words using `unions`

$$code(lang=text)
$$include(code/spelling.lhs#8)
$$/code

The `known` function actually disappears in the Haskell version. Because it takes a set of known words instead of a map of word frequencies, it turns into a direct call to `intersection` lower down.

$$code(lang=text)
$$include(code/spelling.lhs#9)
$$/code

Python has a magic short-circuiting `or` operator, which we have to fake by putting together a list of sets and finding the first non-empty one. Because Haskell is lazy this does in fact short-circuit: for instance, we never make a call to `known_edits2` if we can already find `word` in `knownWords`.

I'm not a fan of `maximumBy` in Haskell, which makes you compare two items yourself; I prefer the Python version, which is similar to .NET's `OrderBy` function. Here, though, the `comparing` function in `Data.Ord` makes the code a little less verbose.

Finally, here's a little command-line demo that corrects words the user types in. It's only at this point that the Haskell version touches the text file that the Python program encapsulates in the `NWORDS` variable; the Haskell version passes the dictionary through each function that needs it. I could have done a direct translation of the Python, but this would have meant writing most of the program as imperative IO monad code, which wasn't really the point of the Haskell translation.
