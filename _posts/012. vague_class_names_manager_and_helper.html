<p class="alt">From <a href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2009/06/05/naming-things-in-code/">journal.stuffwithstuff.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Do not use "Manager" or "Helper" or other null words in a type name.</p>

  <p>If you need to add "Manager" of "Helper" to a type name, the type is either poorly named or poorly designed. Likely the latter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I always agreed with this: names like <code>ConnectionManager</code> and <code>XmlHelper</code> are too vague to be useful. But I never came up with a retort as pithy as this one of Robert Nystrom's:</p>
<blockquote>
  Types should manage and help themselves.
</blockquote>
