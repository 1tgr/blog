<p><em>In response to <a href="http://twitter.com/tim_g_robinson/status/1525616088">a conversation</a> with <a href="http://twitter.com/phil_nash">@phil_nash</a> earlier this week:</em></p>

<p>I have some data from an XML document, along with a string indicating the type of that data, as one of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#built-in-datatypes">XSD type names</a>. The .NET XML serializer knows all about these XSD types, since it'll emit xsi:type attributes on elements that correspond to .NET properties of type object.</p>

<p>However, there doesn't seem to be an easy way of parsing these XSD type names from your own code. <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/">A little digging</a> led me to the XmlSerializationReader.ReadTypedPrimitive method, which is (naturally) declared as private.</p>

<p>At this point I have three options:
<ol>
<li>Call ReadTypedPrimitive directly, using Reflection. Evil, since I'd rather not write code that accesses framework methods declared as private.</li>
<li>Write my own equivalent of the ReadTypedPrimitive method. This appears to involve a giant switch statement.</li>
<li>Come up with some way of persuading the framework to call ReadTypedPrimitive on my behalf.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>The XmlSerializationReader class is in fact used as a base class for the code generated for you when you call the XmlSerializer constructor. I realised that, in order to arrange for the framework to make this method call, I just need a small serializable class that results in the right auto-generated code.</p>

<p>In summary, I went with option 3: construct an XML document in memory, containing the string I originally wanted converted, and the XSD type name supplied to me. Running that through the XmlSerializer causes ReadTypedPrimitive -- with its large switch statement -- to get called, and I end up with a .NET object whose type corresponds to the XSD type of my choice.</p>
