<p>I started learning functional programming in F# and Haskell around 6 months ago, and one of the programs I've been writing in order to learn F# is a small Lisp compiler, with syntax similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>:</p>
[code:plain]
(define (fact n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (fact (- n 1)))))
(Console.WriteLine "6! = {0}" (fact 6))
(Console.WriteLine "What is your name?")
(Console.WriteLine "Hello, {0}" (Console.ReadLine))
[/code]
<p>I'm planning on posting a series of articles explaining how the compiler demonstrates some useful F# features. By way of an introduction, I'd like to talk about two of my favourite features from functional languages: discriminated unions and pattern matching.</p>
<p>At their simplest, discriminated unions are equivalent to .NET enums, since they allow a strongly-types variable to hold one of a fixed set of values:</p>
[code:fsharp]
(*
 * Rough C# equivalent:
 * public enum ListOp { Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Equal }
 *)

type ListOp = Add
            | Subtract 
            | Multiply 
            | Divide 
            | Equal
[/code]
<p>But each of these possible values can be tagged with a data structure, which means that discriminated unions are useful where an object-orientated language would need a hierarchy of classes:</p>
[code:fsharp]
(*
 * Rough C# equivalent:
 * public abstract class LispVal { }
 *
 * public sealed class ArgRef : LispVal
 * {
 *     public ArgRef(int index)
 *     {
 *         Index = index;
 *     }
 *
 *     public int Index { get; private set; }
 * }
 *
 * public sealed class Atom : LispVal
 * {
 *     public Atom(string text)
 *     {
 *         Text = text;
 *     }
 *
 *     public string Text { get; private set; }
 * }
 *
 * etc., for the other cases
 *)
type LispVal = 
             | ArgRef of int                                
             | Atom of string
             | Bool of bool
             | IfPrimitive of LispVal * LispVal * LispVal
             | LambdaDef of string list * LispVal
             | LambdaRef of MethodInfo * bool * Type list
             | List of LispVal list
             | ListPrimitive of ListOp * LispVal list
             | Number of int
             | QuotePrimitive of LispVal
             | String of string
             | VariableDef of string * LispVal
             | VariableRef of LocalBuilder
[/code]
<p>When faced with the task of writing code that understands the C# class hierarchy above, I'd implement the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">Visitor pattern</a>: I'd define an interface called <code>ILispValVisitor</code>, and every time I needed to process a <code>LispVal</code> somehow, I'd declare a nested class that implemented the right <code>ILispValVisitor</code> methods. Fairly straightforward, right? -- a boilerplate class implementation in every piece of code that needs to look inside a <code>LispVal</code>.</p>
<p>Functional languages have a much more elegant alternative, in the form of pattern matching operators. There's no real equivalent to pattern matching in C#, although the concept could be similar to <code>if</code>, <code>switch</code> or the visitor pattern depending on the situation:</p>
[code:fsharp]
(*
 * Rough C# equivalent: an implementation of the visitor pattern
 *)
let rec typeOf (env : Map) = function
    | ArgRef _ -&gt; typeof
    | Atom a -&gt; a |&gt; ident env |&gt; typeOf env
    | Bool _ -&gt; typeof
    | IfPrimitive (_, thenValue, elseValue) -&gt;
        match typeOf env thenValue with
        | t when t = typeOf env elseValue -&gt; t
        | _ -&gt; raise &lt;| Compiler("expected 'then' and 'else' branches to have same type")

    | LambdaDef (_, body) -&gt; typeOf env body
    | LambdaRef (methodBuilder, _, _) -&gt; methodBuilder.ReturnType
    | List (Atom a :: args) -&gt; a |&gt; lambdaIdent args env |&gt; typeOf env
    | List (fn :: _) -&gt; raise &lt;| Compiler(sprintf "can't invoke %A" fn)
    | List [ ] -&gt; raise &lt;| Compiler("can't compile empty list")
    | ListPrimitive _ -&gt; typeof
    | Number _ -&gt; typeof
    | String _ -&gt; typeof
    | QuotePrimitive _ -&gt; typeof
    | VariableDef _ -&gt; typeof
    | VariableRef local -&gt; local.LocalType
[/code]
<p>The Lisp compiler I wrote relies on a discriminated union, <code>LispVal</code> for storing expression trees, and pattern matching for most of its processing. I'll post more in-depth articles covering the source code in detail, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Parsing with fslex and fsyacc</li>

  <li>Code generation using <code>System.Reflection.Emit</code></li>

  <li>Calling the compiler from C#</li>
</ul>
