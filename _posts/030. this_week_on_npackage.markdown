I implemented the local package database idea that I mentioned last weekend. Now the NPackage client downloads a [packages.js](http://np.partario.com/packages.js) file that describes every version of every package; now you don't have to specify full package file URLs with version numbers. I've also switched to [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) syntax for the package files, instead of using my hand-made Yaml-ish parser.

I want to do at least two more things before putting togther an NPackage version 1.0 release:

 * Packages should be able to depend on other packages. These dependencies should consist of a package name and, optionally, the range of version numbers that are acceptable. NPackage will pick the latest version of each package that satisfies all the version number constraints.
 * Developers should be able to set up a local package repository that takes prececdence over the web site

Hopefully I'll at least have dependencies working by next weekend.
