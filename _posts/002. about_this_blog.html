<p>I'm not sure how this will turn out, but what I'm hoping to do here is to write about whatever side project I happen to be doing at the time. This blog is likely to stay technical: I'm planning to keep my photography separate at <a href="http://www.partario.com/photos/">http://www.partario.com/photos/</a>. I reckon this blog -- with the writing -- is likely to have a different kind of audience from the photoblog.</p>
