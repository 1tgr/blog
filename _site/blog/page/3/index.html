  <span class="post_prose">
    
  <p id="p1"><strong class="alt">Update:</strong> Thanks to the commenters on this blog and on Reddit, I've got <a href="http://www.partario.com/blog/2009/11/an-improved-spelling-corrector-in-haskell.html">a much improved and more readable Haskell port</a> of the spelling corrector.</p>
<p id="p2">On Wednesday I attended the <a href="http://stackoverflow.carsonified.com/events/london/">StackOverflow DevDay</a> in London, which was a day of excellent talks by engaging speakers. Michael Sparks gave a talk on Python, where he built up <a href="http://www.norvig.com/spell-correct.html">Peter Norvig's spelling corrector</a> line by line as we watched. I was impressed by how easy it was to understand the source code, and the style struck me as being particularly functional. So, I was compelled to translate the Python source into Haskell.</p>
<p id="p3">This post is also a Literate Haskell program, meaning that you should be able to copy the text from the page, paste it into a <code>.lhs</code> file, and compile it. Snippets starting with <code>&gt;</code> are Haskell; in between is Peter's original program, and my commentary on the differences.</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre> # Python region looks like this:
import re, collections

&gt; -- Haskell region looks like this:
&gt; module Main where
&gt;
&gt; import Char
&gt; import qualified Data.List as List
&gt; import qualified Data.Map as Map
&gt; import qualified Data.Set as Set
&gt; import Data.Ord
&gt; import IO
&gt; import List
</pre></div>

<p id="p4">Every language needs some imports. The Python program only has two; we're using a scattering of functions outside of the prelude (Haskell's standard library), so we need to import a bit more:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Char</code> gives us <code>toLower</code> and <code>isAlpha</code></li>
<li><code>Data.List</code> gives us <code>foldl'</code></li>
<li><code>Data.Map</code> gives us the <code>Map</code> type</li>
<li><code>Data.Set</code> gives us the <code>Set</code> type</li>
<li><code>Data.Ord</code> gives us the <code>comparing</code> function</li>
<li><code>IO</code> gives us <code>isEOF</code></li>
<li><code>List</code> gives us <code>maximumBy</code></li>
</ul>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>def words(text): return re.findall('[a-z]+', text.lower())

&gt; lowerWords = filter (not . null) . map (map toLower . filter isAlpha) . words
</pre></div>

<p id="p5">The Haskell prelude already has a function called words, which splits a string by spaces. <code>filter isAlpha</code> and <code>filter (not . null)</code> approximate the Python regular expression:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>filter isAlpha</code> drops all characters outside of a-z</li>
<li><code>filter (not . null)</code> excludes any empty strings (such as sequences of numbers or punctuation in the original text)</li>
</ul>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>def train(features):
    model = collections.defaultdict(lambda: 1)
    for f in features:
        model[f] += 1
    return model

&gt; train = List.foldl' (\dict word -&gt; Map.insertWith' (+) word (1::Int) dict) Map.empty 
</pre></div>

<p id="p6">Haskell doesn't need an explicit loop here: we use <code>foldl'</code> to iterate over the list of words and add each one to a map. The <code>Map.insertWith'</code> function either inserts a value (if missing), or extracts the existing value, applies it to a function, and inserts the result back in the map.</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>NWORDS = train(words(file('big.txt').read()))

&gt; readNWORDS = readFile "big.txt" &gt;&gt;= return . train . lowerWords
</pre></div>

<p id="p7">A big difference in the Haskell version is that file I/O is encapsulated in an IO monad. So whereas Python's <code>NWORDS</code> variable is an actual dictionary, <code>readNWORDS</code> is a I/O value that, when executed, reads and parses a file and yields a dictionary.</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

&gt; alphabet = [ 'a' .. 'z' ]
</pre></div>

<p id="p8">I put a cheeky shortcut in the Haskell version. (It makes no difference to the line count.)</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>def edits1(word):
   s = [(word[:i], word[i:]) for i in range(len(word) + 1)]
   deletes    = [a + b[1:] for a, b in s if b]
   transposes = [a + b[1] + b[0] + b[2:] for a, b in s if len(b)&gt;1]
   replaces   = [a + c + b[1:] for a, b in s for c in alphabet if b]
   inserts    = [a + c + b     for a, b in s for c in alphabet]
   return set(deletes + transposes + replaces + inserts)

&gt; edits1 word =
&gt;     let s = [ (take i word, drop i word) | i &lt;- [ 0 .. length word ] ]
&gt;         deletes    = [ a ++ tail b | (a, b) &lt;- s, not $ null b ]
&gt;         transposes = [ a ++ b!!1 : b!!0 : drop 2 b | (a, b) &lt;- s, not $ null b, not $ null $ tail b ]
&gt;         replaces   = [ a ++ c : tail b | (a, b) &lt;- s, c &lt;- alphabet, not $ null b ]
&gt;         inserts    = [ a ++ c : b | (a, b) &lt;- s, c &lt;- alphabet ]
&gt;     in Set.fromList (deletes ++ transposes ++ replaces ++ inserts)
</pre></div>

<p id="p9">The Haskell and Python versions of this function are fairly close. The main differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haskell uses the <code>let</code> ... <code>in</code> keywords to declare values</li>
<li>List comprehension syntax is very similar, if you replace Python's <code>for</code> and <code>in</code> with Haskell's <code>|</code> and <code>&lt;-</code>. (Recurring theme: Haskell prefers symbols to keywords.)</li>
<li><code>[ start .. end ]</code> is Haskell's built-in range syntax. It's lazy, and generates elements only on demand, which means it's fine to construct an infinite list like this: <code>[ 1 .. ]</code></li>
<li>Python has neat string slicing syntax:</li>
<li><code>[:i]</code> is replaced with <code>take i</code>, to take the first <em>i</em> characters</li>
<li><code>[i:]</code> is replaced with <code>drop i</code>, to take all but the first <em>i</em> characters</li>
<li>Subscripts can be replaced with the <code>!!</code> operators, which does the same thing, but with O(<em>N</em>) complexity. Remember Haskell's strings are lists of characters, not arrays (although see <code>Data.ByteString</code>).</li>
<li>Python's <code>if</code> keyword maps to different things depending on the context. Here it's used to ask 'is the string empty?', and we replace it with the <code>not</code> and <code>null</code> functions.</li>
<li><code>++</code> and <code>:</code> stand in for Python's <code>+</code> operator, depending on whether we're concatenating two lists (<code>a ++ b</code>) or pushing a single element onto the start of a list (<code>head : tail</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p id="p10">I'm not totally convinced about the performance of the Haskell version, since <code>take</code> and <code>drop</code> are O(<em>N</em>) and not O(1). However, <em>N</em> is small here, being the length of a word. If it's a problem we could use <code>ByteString</code> instead for O(1) complexity at the price of having to copy strings.</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>def known_edits2(word):
    return set(e2 for e1 in edits1(word) for e2 in edits1(e1) if e2 in NWORDS)

&gt; known_edits2 knownWords = Set.unions . Set.elems . Set.map (Set.intersection knownWords . edits1) . edits1
</pre></div>

<p id="p11">Here I replaced the Python list comprehensions with Haskell's built-in set functions. We can't iterate directly over a set in Haskell, so if we used a list comprehension here, we'd to use <code>elems</code> to produce a list from the set and <code>fromList</code> to turn the result into a set again. Here I feel that the Python version demonstrates the intent more clearly, which is to produce a set of edits from <code>edit1</code>, then run those through <code>edit1</code> again, and keep only the edits that turn out to be real words.</p>
<p id="p12">Read from right to left, what the Haskell version does is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Produces a set of edits to a word using <code>edit1</code></li>
<li>For each edit in the set, produce another set of edits using <code>edit1</code>, and keep only those edits-of-edits that can be found in <code>knownWords</code>. We now have a set of sets.</li>
<li>Turn a set of sets into a list of sets, using <code>elems</code></li>
<li>Collapse that list of sets into a single set of words using <code>unions</code></li>
</ul>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>def known(words): return set(w for w in words if w in NWORDS)

&gt; -- no Haskell equivalent
</pre></div>

<p id="p13">The <code>known</code> function actually disappears in the Haskell version. Because it takes a set of known words instead of a map of word frequencies, it turns into a direct call to <code>intersection</code> lower down.</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>def correct(word):
    candidates = known([word]) or known(edits1(word)) or known_edits2(word) or [word]
    return max(candidates, key=NWORDS.get)

&gt; correct nwords word = 
&gt;     let knownWords = Map.keysSet nwords
&gt;         candidates = Set.elems
&gt;                    $ head
&gt;                    $ filter (not . Set.null)
&gt;                    $ [ Set.intersection knownWords $ Set.singleton word,
&gt;                        Set.intersection knownWords $ edits1 word,
&gt;                        known_edits2 knownWords word,
&gt;                        Set.singleton word ]
&gt;       in maximumBy (comparing (\w -&gt; w `Map.lookup` nwords)) candidates
</pre></div>

<p id="p14">Python has a magic short-circuiting <code>or</code> operator, which we have to fake by putting together a list of sets and finding the first non-empty one. Because Haskell is lazy this does in fact short-circuit: for instance, we never make a call to <code>known_edits2</code> if we can already find <code>word</code> in <code>knownWords</code>.</p>
<p id="p15">I'm not a fan of <code>maximumBy</code> in Haskell, which makes you compare two items yourself; I prefer the Python version, which is similar to .NET's <code>OrderBy</code> function. Here, though, the <code>comparing</code> function in <code>Data.Ord</code> makes the code a little less verbose.</p>
<p id="p16">Finally, here's a little command-line demo that corrects words the user types in. It's only at this point that the Haskell version touches the text file that the Python program encapsulates in the <code>NWORDS</code> variable; the Haskell version passes the dictionary through each function that needs it. I could have done a direct translation of the Python, but this would have meant writing most of the program as imperative IO monad code, which wasn't really the point of the Haskell translation.</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>&gt; prompt nwords = do
&gt;     eof &lt;- isEOF
&gt;     if eof
&gt;       then return ()
&gt;       else do
&gt;           getLine &gt;&gt;= putStrLn . correct nwords
&gt;           prompt nwords
&gt; 
&gt; main = readNWORDS &gt;&gt;= prompt

  </small>
  <span class="post_prose">
    
  <p id="p1">In <a href="http://www.partario.com/blog/2009/07/whats-a-control-flow-graph.html">my last Lisp compiler post</a>, I talked about what I might need to do in order to support tail-recursive calls. I came to the conclusion that my compiler need to start describing the program as a graph of linked basic blocks.</p>
<p id="p2">To summarise, a basic block obeys two rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a single entry point: the program isn't allowed to branch into the middle of the block</li>
<li>It has a single exit point: the block always contains a single branch instruction, which appears at the end</li>
</ul>
<p id="p3">For instance, here's a graph of a program that uses a recursive <code>factorial</code> function:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0) 
    1 
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
(Console.WriteLine (factorial 6))
</pre></div>

<p id="p4"><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Factorial.png" src="http://www.partario.com/blog/2009/08/02/Factorial.png" width="543" height="643" class="mt-image-none" style=""/></span></p>
<p id="p5">Here I've marked graph edges with a .NET branch instruction (in this case, <code>br</code>, <code>beq</code> or <code>ret</code>). These edges link the graph's nodes -- the basic blocks -- which is where the other instructions in the program appear. A block doesn't need to contain any instructions; for instance, the <em>then</em> and <em>else</em> branches of the <code>if</code> block both lead unconditionally to a single empty block, which in turn exits the function.</p>
<p id="p6">To represent the data structures in the graph I added three F# types to the compiler. All of them are immutable apart from <code>ILBlock</code>'s <code>Branch</code> field, which I made mutable in order to allow circular references between blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ILOpCode</code>: a discriminated union with one case for each IL opcode that can appear inside a block -- <code>Add</code>, <code>Box of Type</code>, <code>Call of MethodInfo</code>, etc. Note that <code>call</code> is not considered a branching opcode for these purposes, since it doesn't interrupt the control flow.</li>
<li><code>ILBranchOpCode</code>: a discriminated union with one case for each IL opcode that can appear at the end of a block - <code>Beq of ILBlock * ILBlock</code>, <code>Br of ILBlock</code>, <code>Brtrue of ILBlock * ILBlock</code>, <code>NoBranch</code> and <code>Ret</code>. The values for <code>Beq</code> and <code>Brtrue</code> specify both branch possibilities. Each <code>ILBranchOpCode</code> represents an edge in the graph.</li>
<li><code>ILBlock</code>: a record containing a list of <code>IlOpCode</code> and a mutable <code>ILBranchOpCode</code> field. Each <code>ILBlock</code> represents a basic block; that is, a node in the graph that can be linked by two or more <code>ILBranchOpCode</code>s.</li>
</ul>
<p id="p7">These new data structures now allow me to split the code concerned with IL generation into two parts: a large function that turns the abstract syntax tree into a graph of basic blocks, and a class that takes this graph and uses it to emit IL code through an <code>ILGenerator</code>. (Actually there are two of these classes -- <code>DynamicMethodTarget</code> and <code>MethodBuilderTarget</code> -- because there is no common base between the two classes .NET provides to instantiate an <code>ILGenerator</code>.)</p>
<p id="p8">I won't list out the code in full, since I've submitted it to GitHub (<a href="http://github.com/timrobinson/fsharp-lisp/blob/cbabb14119c6438126bb563f4e737d5847d0827f/Core/CodeGenerator.fs">CodeGeneration.fs</a>) and because it's got broadly the same structure as <a href="http://www.partario.com/blog/2009/06/lisp-compiler-in-f-il-generation.html">the last time I posted it</a>. The difference is that most of the work is performed by a <code>makeBlock</code> function:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">makeBlock</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">IILTarget</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">Map</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nc">LispVal</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">LispVal</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">Map</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nc">LispVal</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nc">ILBlock</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nc">ILBlock</span>
</pre></div>

<p id="p9">The purpose of this function is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accept an <code>IILTarget</code>, an interface capable of defining new methods and local variables; a map, which contains the environment at this point in the program; and a <code>LispVal</code>, which represents one line of code</li>
<li>Return a new environment, which could be modified version of the one passed in; and two <code>ILBlock</code> instances, which represent the head and tail of a new subgraph</li>
</ul>
<p id="p10">Normally <code>makeBlock</code> will construct only a single block, in which case both the same block object will be returned twice. An <code>if</code> form is more complicated, in that it consists of a diamond shape: the block that contains the code for the test can branch to either the <em>then</em> or the <em>else</em> block, both of which eventually branch back to the same location so that the program can continue. When generating code for an <code>if</code>, <code>makeBlock</code> will return the blocks at the top and bottom of the diamond, ready to be linked together with the rest of the program. (The edges between the <em>then</em> and <em>else</em> blocks are already added.)</p>
<p id="p11">Now the the clever part: because we've got the program's structure and code as a graph in memory, we can do some more interesting optimisations. The process of turning this graph into IL goes as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Iterate through the graph and assign a IL label to each block. With a depth-first recursive search we have to be careful not to get stuck in a circular reference: to avoid this we keep track of blocks we've already encountered.</li>
<li>Iterate through the graph again: generate instructions for each block, followed by an instruction for the block's branch</li>
</ol>
<p id="p12">Take a look at the diagram at the top of this post. Because the diagram doesn't assume a particular ordering of the instructions in memory -- for instance, it doesn't specify whether <em>then</em> or <em>else</em> comes first -- some of its branch instructions are redundant. To generate somewhat sensible IL we have to do some basic optimisations in step (2):</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="alt">Case A:</span> If step (1) put two blocks next to each other in memory, we don't need to insert a <code>br</code> instruction between them. Recall that <code>br</code> is an unconditional jump instruction; by leaving it out, we cause the program to fall through from one block to the next.</li>
<li><span class="alt">Cases B and C:</span> Likewise, use the ordering of the blocks to drop one of the targets of <code>beq</code> and replace it with a fall through</li>
<li><span class="alt">Case D:</span> If block branches to its target using <code>br</code>, and its target contains no instructions and ends in <code>ret</code>, insert a <code>ret</code> instruction directly</li>
</ul>
<p id="p13">These rules give us a nice opportunity to use pattern matching -- note how the structure of the code is similar to my explanation above:</p>

<p id="p14">Finally -- and here's what I've been building up to with these last couple of posts -- we can implement tail call recursion, using the <code>tail.call</code> prefix. Our graph data structures allow us to literally look for the situation that the IL spec requires: a <code>call</code> instruction immediately followed by <code>ret</code>. In our case, this happens when a block's branch is <code>Ret</code>, and the last instruction of that block is <code>Call</code>:</p>

<p id="p15">By reorganising my compiler to support tail recursion I've learned that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing your data structures (in this case, implementing a control flow graph) can often make a previously difficult algorithm (tail call detection) straightforward</li>
<li>If you haven't got any unit tests, you're not refactoring, you're just changing stuff. I've now written <a href="http://github.com/timrobinson/fsharp-lisp/blob/cbabb14119c6438126bb563f4e737d5847d0827f/Core.UnitTests/CompilerTests.fs">unit tests for the main features supported by the compiler</a>. As an aside, I think NUnit tests written in F# look nicer than their C# equivalents, although I was slightly disappointed that NUnit made me write a class with instance methods, whereas it would have been neater to have some functions for test cases defined directly inside an F# module.</li>
<li>Writing a blog post on a topic before attempting it is a great way to get your thoughts clear in your head before starting</li>
</ul>
<p id="p16">What I might look at next is some more sophisticated algorithms over the control flow graph. Once you have a graph you make available a whole field of algorithms to use on your data. I haven't looked at it yet in detail, but I like Steve Horsfield's <a href="http://stevehorsfield.wordpress.com/2009/07/27/f-a-data-structure-for-modelling-directional-graphs/">data structure for modelling directional graphs</a>.</p>

  <p id="p1"><span class="alt">(The second in what seems to be a day of obscure .NET facts)</span></p>
<p id="p2">While looking at some C++/CLI code in Reflector today at work, we encountered the <code>try ... fault</code> construct.</p>
<h3>What's a <code>fault</code> block?</h3>
<p id="p3">It's like a <code>finally</code> block, but it's only entered in the event of an exception.</p>
<h3>So it's like a <code>catch</code> block, then?</h3>
<p id="p4">Not exactly: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>fault</code> blocks don't have filters like <code>catch</code> blocks do</li>
<li>At the end of a <code>fault</code> block the exception is implicitly rethrown</li>
</ul>
<p id="p5">Supposedly the benefit of a <code>fault</code> block is performance: that <code>throw;</code> statement at the end of a <code>catch</code> block has the same overhead as any other <code>throw</code> statement, whereas <code>finally</code> and <code>fault</code> blocks incur no runtime overhead. The stack is not unwound when a <code>fault</code> block is entered: <code>fault</code> blocks won't appear in the exception stack trace.</p>
<h3>Where do <code>fault</code> blocks show up?</h3>
<p id="p6">In the code the C++/CLI compiler emits in order to make sure that local variables have their destructors called in the event of an exception.</p>

  <p id="p1">Daniel Fortunov wrote about <a href="http://www.danielfortunov.com/software/$daniel_fortunovs_adventures_in_software_development/2009/07/28/duck_typing">an obscure use of duck typing in the C# spec for enumerators</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="p2">Although it is common to implement [IEnumerable and IEnumerator] when creating an enumerable class, if you were to drop the interfaces but leave the implementation, your class would still be enumerable by foreach. Voila! Duck-typing!</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p3">You can take advantage of this fact for a couple of performance tricks, as demonstrated by many of the standard collection classes in the base class library:</p>
<ul>
<li>Declare your <code>IEnumerator&lt;T&gt;</code> implementation as a struct, not a class. This saves you a heap allocation when <code>MoveNext</code> is called.</li>
<li>Define a <code>Enumerator&lt;T&gt; GetEnumerator()</code> method on your collection class</li>
<li>Note that you're returning your own struct, not <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>; this avoids a boxing operation. You'll still need to explicitly implement <code>IEnumerator&lt;T&gt; GetEnumerator()</code>, for people who only have an <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> reference to your collection. These performance tricks don't apply when you're making calls through this interface.</li>
</ul>
<p id="p4">When somebody uses <code>foreach</code> over your collection, the compiler sees a series of <code>MoveNext</code> calls and accesses to the <code>Current</code> property, and it emits code to call these efficiently on your struct.</p>
<p id="p5">What's more, the code in your struct's methods is a candidate for <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/davidnotario/archive/2004/11/01/250398.aspx">inlining by the JIT compiler</a>. The segment of the <code>MoveNext</code> method of <code>System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;T&gt;+Enumerator</code> that can throw an exception is split into its own method, apparently for this reason.</p>
<p id="p6">I don't claim any kind of definite performance benefits from using these techniques, but it does look like the language designers put some thought into making it possible to use <code>foreach</code> without incurring any overhead compared to some less elegant method.</p>

  <p id="p1">I'd like to add tail call support to my <a href="http://www.partario.com/blog/2009/06/lisp-compiler-in-f-whats-next.html">Lisp compiler</a>. I can think of two approaches to tail recursion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the .NET <code>tail.call</code> prefix<ul>
<li>Translate <code>call</code> followed by <code>ret</code> into <code>tail.call</code> followed by <code>ret</code></li>
<li>It's easier to spot this pattern if we put IL in our own data structure before emitting it</li>
<li>Our own data structure needs to represent all the IL we use, including labels (for branching) and local variables</li>
<li>The label data structure needs a way to represent the target of a branch</li>
<li><span class="alt">Note:</span> The <code>tail</code> prefix is a hint that the JIT compiler doesn't have to obey - <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/clrcodegeneration/archive/2009/05/11/tail-call-improvements-in-net-framework-4.aspx">here's a good explanation of the limitations</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Translate functions that call themselves into loops<ul>
<li>Our abstract syntax tree doesn't have a way to represent a loop</li>
<li>As above, it needs an AST capable of representing branches</li>
<li>The F# compiler does this; it's not able to rely on the <code>tail</code> prefix either</li>
<li>Can we apply this to functions that call each other recursively? At compile time we might not spot co-recursive functions: F# only allows co-recursive functions if they use the <code>let ... and</code> syntax to define both functions in the same source file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p2">The ability to represent loops, and control flow in general, seems to be important in your syntax tree. The <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> approach to this is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_block">basic block</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>One entry point: no branching into the middle of the block</li>
<li>One exit point: always contains one branch instruction, at the end</li>
<li>Basic blocks can be connected to form a control flow graph: blocks are vertices, branch instructions are edges</li>
<li>Control flow graph is: directed (A branches to B); cyclic (A is allowed to branch to A - this is a loop)</li>
</ul>
<p id="p3">How can we represent basic blocks in F#? The intuitive approach means defining a discriminated union:</p>

<p id="p4">We have to construct a list of instructions before constructing a basic block. But how do we represent the following?</p>

<p id="p5">The answer is to separate identity of basic blocks from the instructions within them. We could assign names or ids to them. Or, since we're writing F# and not Haskell, we could drop immutability:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="o">//</span> <span class="nc">F</span><span class="o">#</span> <span class="n">abstract</span> <span class="n">syntax</span> <span class="n">tree</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">mutability</span> <span class="o">-</span>

<p id="p6">LLVM does something similar with its C++ API:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="c1">// LLVM equivalent in C++</span>

</pre></div>

<p id="p7">I'm not yet sure of all the implications for my toy compiler, but already I can see some indications about how to structure the code to allow for optimisations like tail calling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structure the entire program as a graph of basic blocks linked by branch instructions</li>
<li>Abstract syntax trees can't do everything; instead, they appear as instructions within basic blocks</li>
<li>Construction of basic blocks must be separate from construction of the instructions within them, so that we can refer to a basic block from one of its own instructions</li>
<li>As it progresses through compiler passes, the program graph starts looking less functional and more imperative, until it eventually represents actual machine instructions</li>
<li>I should probably read <a href="http://dragonbook.stanford.edu/">a compiler textbook</a></li>
